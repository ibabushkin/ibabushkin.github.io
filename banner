This is my personal blog. Some thoughts and observation will
go here. No more, no less. For further reference, I (obviously)
have a github account <a href="https://www.github.com/ibabushkin">here</a>.

For gabelstaplerwm, there are some documentation files available
<a href="https://ibabushkin.github.io/rustdoc/gabelstaplerwm/gabelstaplerwm">here</a>.
They are rebuild on every push of the repository, so they can be assumed to be
up-to-date, as long as I update this repo.
