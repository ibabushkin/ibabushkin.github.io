<h1 id="x-is-a-can-of-worms---writing-a-window-manager-in-rust">X is a Can of Worms - Writing a Window Manager in Rust</h1>
<p>As promised in the last entry, I'll write a bit about my first larger Rust project: A window manager using the XCB bindings to the X protocol. I chose this for a multitude of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Xlib has a lot of issues with performance, bloat and bugs, and all WM's I know of that are written in Rust use this interface - although there are bindings to the XCB library, which has neither of those issues.</li>
<li>Some features and ideas that apply to (tiling) window manager design and development aren't realized to their full potential in my opinion - particularly the differentiation between static and dynamic tiling window managers allows for further development.</li>
<li>Learning Rust <em>properly</em> in a bigger project is something worth my time, especially as this involves a more low-level project.</li>
</ul>
<p>In conclusion, such a task fills a gap. Why not fill it?</p>
<p>At this point you might ask yourself &gt; Why the salty title?</p>
<p>The answer is pretty simple: XCB is very poorly documented, and it's extension libraries don't even announce their existence properly on the web. Yes, you've heard that one right - the extension libraries that provide functions to implement <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Window_Manager_Hints">EWMH</a> (more on that later) and other things lack everything but the source code.</p>
<p>When I finally found them, got the source and thought about providing Rust bindings, I was greeted by two levels of <code>m4</code> and <code>CPP</code> macros. Very... inviting. This quickly rendered my idea pretty useless - even providing Haskell bindings for Capstone wasn't an entirely pleasant experience, a fair bit was boring, the rest is documented here - and this libraries would be much worse: Apparently, the code is preprocessed heavily, and for some reason constants whose origin I was unable to trace get replaced as well.</p>
<p>Long, boring story short: I was able to find the implementation of the functions commonly used by C window managers to emulate the same procedures in Rust.</p>
<p>However, writing code for a big, legacy-ridden protocol is a bit tedious and documentation is abysmal as I mentioned already.</p>
<p>To conclude these pointless ramblings - It's not at all as bad as it sounds: Basic structure is done already and progress is being made. When I have a solid technical overview of the window manager ready, I will write about it. So far, you can look at the code if you wish: <a href="https://github.com/ibabushkin/gabelstaplerwm">gabelstaplerwm</a>, which is badly documented and ugly so far - that seems to be good taste in the world of X programming.</p>
