<p>As mentioned in the last post, I've begun working on my very own window manager written in Rust. And it has been a success so far, even though most of the problems with X itself are still present and keep me up at night.</p>
<p>However, some progress has been made, on which I will reiterate now.</p>
<p>First of all, the core of the window manager is working and reasonably performant, and the necessary interfaces and data structures have been implemented. Among the things that work are:</p>
<ul>
<li>window focus</li>
<li>layouts and tags</li>
<li>redrawing on demand</li>
<li>keybindings</li>
<li>user config in a seperate Rust file</li>
</ul>
<p>However, some things still need to be implemented:</p>
<ul>
<li>properly working window borders (ATM colors behave weirdly)</li>
<li>launching things and other additional functionality</li>
<li>more config features</li>
</ul>
<p>So much for today, the code is at the same place: <a href="https://github.com/ibabushkin/gabelstaplerwm">gabelstaplerwm</a>.</p>
