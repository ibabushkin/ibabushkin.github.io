<h1 id="non-reparenting-window-managers-and-firefox">Non-reparenting Window Managers and Firefox</h1>
<p>As I mentioned in the previous <a href="https://ibabushkin.github.io/0x0E%20-%20A%20Guide%20to%20gabelstaplerwm%20and%20an%20Overview%20of%20Current%20Bugs">article</a>, <code>gabelstaplerwm</code> exposes particularly weird behaviour in Firefox' UI. This, to put it mildly, sucks, so I started investigating this issue which manifests itself exposing the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>extreme UI lag when running <code>gabelstaplerwm</code> or <code>dwm</code> as a window manager, however no trace of this behaviour when running inside <code>Xephyr</code>.</li>
<li>firefox is the only application affected.</li>
<li><code>awesomewm</code> isn't affected on my hardware, others have confirmed the bug when running <code>dwm</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, when we collect all this information, one thing becomes apparent: Neither <code>dwm</code> nor <code>gabelstaplerwm</code> are so-called <em>reparenting window managers</em>, but <code>awesomewm</code> and most other modern window managers are.</p>
<h2 id="but-what-does-it-mean-and-why-should-firefox-care">But what does it mean? And why should firefox care?</h2>
<p>A <em>reparenting window manager</em> is making use of a functionality of the X protocol that allows to change the parent of a particular window (which itself is a window). That bit is pretty obvious given the name. But why would one want to do that? The most common use-case for window managers is drawing window decoration around the windows belonging to individual clients. This includes titlebars, buttons...</p>
<p>When we avoid reparenting, realizing features like this becomes really cumbersome. You have to keep track of a window's size and create, draw and maintain the state of a sibling window that would contain all the decoration. Besides, if said bells and whistles are of a more complex shape or located on multiple sides of the window, this becomes more complicated than you could ever hope it to be.</p>
<p>The alternative is to create a toplevel window and reparent the client's window to it, making it it's child and only ever need to handle relative size and position.</p>
<p>That said, reparenting is also done on a different level, the EWMH standard requires it to be done with a toplevel child of the root window to... I don't know why, don't even try to open these gates of hell.</p>
<h3 id="and-what-does-xephyr-do">And what does Xephyr do?</h3>
<p>I suspect it to emulate only parts of the X protocol and somehow leaking the hierarchy of windows above it's level (thus not inside the nested X instance), as such a detail would explain why firefox changes it's behaviour when in a non-reparenting WM that runs on a bare display vs. a virtual one.</p>
<p>This all points to firefox somehow disliking being the direct child of the root window. Butâ€¦ why should firefox care, exactly? I don't know. But we seem to live in a crazy world.</p>
<h2 id="now-that-were-through-with-the-analysis...">Now that we're through with the analysis...</h2>
<p>... let's try to address the problem. I quickly hacked together a version of <code>gabelstaplerwm</code> that does something remotely resembling the reparenting concept of EWMH - it simply creates a fake root window and reparents everything else. This approach is totally broken considering it ignores a lot of infrastructure needed for a proper implementation, but that's what <code>git</code> branches are for. So a few lines of XCB calls later... nothing changed.</p>
<p>This is a letdown. Moreover, other people don't have any issues on <code>xmonad</code>, which apparently doesn't reparent either, and firefox.</p>
<p>Meh.</p>
<p>Sounds much more involved and I currently lack any further ideas. Maybe I should check back on my fire-and-forget-implementation of reparenting and see if it lacks some important bit.</p>
<h2 id="but-why-arent-your-reparenting-in-the-first-place">But why aren't your reparenting in the first place?</h2>
<p>Similarly to the choices made by the <code>dwm</code> developers, reparenting simply shouldn't be necessary for a tiling window manager which doesn't aim to provide window decoration or similar features (see the <a href="https://github.com/ibabushkin/gabelstaplerwm/blob/master/README.md">README</a> for the reasons). It's more complicated than necessary and involves a lot of mechanical work.</p>
<p>That's enough reason for me. Sadly, at least some apps (* <em>cough</em> * Java * <em>cough</em> *) have had problems with that, so I might implement a simple variant to avoid that.</p>
<p>That's it for now.</p>
