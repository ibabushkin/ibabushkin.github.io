<h1 id="a-small-update">A small update</h1>
<p>This post is a small reminder that I still exist and occasionally do stuff. Particularly, I've resumed the development of <a href="https://github.com/ibabushkin/gabelstaplerwm">gabelstaplerwm</a> after a small break. A lot of (breaking) and maybe even exciting changes are taking place right now, as I am in the process of adding new features while fixing bugs and addressing architectural issues at the same time. All in all, I am quite content that the project will reach a stable state in the next few months, depending on my time. Then, I can focus on cleaning up the code, providing a nice default config, documenting everything and getting the first usable version released.</p>
<p>However, other things have been done as well - I started writing a simple <code>weechat</code> plugin to integrate it with <code>telegram-cli</code>, and wasted a lot of my time on other, not really useful things as well.</p>
<p>Sadly, I didn't make much progress on the decompilation implementation in Haskell - I generally didn't do much Haskell lately, which is pretty sad, considering my love for the language and it's ecosystem. However, I couldn't find an appropriate project for it that I could hack on, which left me in the current situation. However, since I (non-deliberately) paused my Haskell-development I noticed I started using a more functional programming style in Rust. That's a good turn, because it signals improved understanding of the language, but still has it's aesthetic flaws - I don't think my Rust code is particularly beautiful. More practise should fix this as well I hope.</p>
<p>Next post will be on more project ideas (if I get some), maybe describe some progress in the things mentioned here. I also plan to write short (weekly?) posts with small discussions of interesting things I've found.</p>
