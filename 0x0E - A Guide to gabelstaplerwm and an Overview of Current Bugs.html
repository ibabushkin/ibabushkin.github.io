<h1 id="a-guide-to-gabelstaplerwm-and-an-overview-of-current-bugs">A Guide to <code>gabelstaplerwm</code> and an Overview of Current Bugs</h1>
<p>And here we go again with a new post about <code>gabelstaplerwm</code>. I figured I'm getting a bit annoying, but for some reason they just keep coming. However, this time we will simply look at configuration management and some observations I've made while attempting a transition to using it full-time. Mind the &quot;attempt&quot;, as I haven't done that yet. The reasons are twofold: For once, I have a lot of things to do ;). And some bugs keep manifesting, that make the process more painful than it has to be. See the second part of the article for more information on that topic.</p>
<h2 id="configuring-gabelstaplerwm">Configuring <code>gabelstaplerwm</code></h2>
<p>The configuration system is heavily inspired by <code>dwm</code> and other <a href="http://suckless.org/">suckless</a> tools that are configured at compile time. However, because rust is the programming language used, the process differs a bit. The intended configuration done by the user is supposed to be constrainted to the <code>src/wm/config.rs</code> file. That said, you probably want to read the <a href="https://github.com/ibabushkin/gabelstaplerwm">source</a> and <a href="https://ibabushkin.github.io/rustdoc/gabelstaplerwm/">documentation</a> anyway. However, the most important concepts to grasp are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The structure present in the file is already sufficient for configuration. Look at the surrounding infrastructure to see how you can change it if you need to (for instance, if your configuration grows big enough to warrant such a change).</li>
<li>A lot of the repetitive calls and closures needed in a typical configuration are abstracted away using a set of macros located in <code>src/wm/util.rs</code>. Make sure to look at those if you find yourself writing a lot of boilerplate.</li>
<li>If you think that you've found something that is worth adding to the core of the window manager, feel free to contribute that change back! The config system would only benefit from more sets of hands (and eyes) that have touched it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now let us walk through the default configuration to illustrate on the above points. We will focus on keybindings in particular, but also on the other features.</p>
<h3 id="defining-tags">Defining <code>Tag</code>s</h3>
<p>Tags are an enum with members that that represent individual tags windows can be associated with. Don't alter the derived traits. Or rather, make sure those traits are implemented in a sane fashion. Also see the implementation of the <code>Display</code> trait, you might want/need to alter it.</p>
<h3 id="defining-keyboard-modes">Defining Keyboard <code>Mode</code>s</h3>
<p>Modes are an enum as well, and all things that apply to the <code>Tag</code> enum apply to them as well. In both cases you should make sure that they are not empty and present.</p>
<h3 id="setting-a-window-manager-config">Setting a window manager <code>Config</code></h3>
<p>The <code>generate_config</code> function is responsible for that part. Leave it's type signature unaltered (or alter the infrastructure in <code>src/main.rs</code>) and do the obvious things you need with it. Note that it is a function to allow for dynamic generation of a suitable config during startup. This will allow for greater flexibility in the future, when multimonitor support is added.</p>
<h3 id="doing-all-other-configuration-work-on-startup">Doing all other configuration work on startup</h3>
<p>The <code>setup_wm</code> function gets passed a mutable reference to the newly created window manager object. This is the place where keybindings are added, <code>TagSet</code>s are initialized and the client matching is set up. Note the usage of macros for keybinding-related tasks. The individual keys are identified by keycode and modifier set. To see the related constants, check out the <code>src/wm/kbd.rs</code> file for the modifier constants and type information for the callback closures. The <code>gabelstaplergrab</code> utility might be of use as well to determine the keycodes of the keys you want to bind to, just run it instead of a window manager, possibly with <code>Xephyr</code>. The <code>xephyr</code> script in the toplevel directory wraps that bit.</p>
<h2 id="known-bugs-and-limitations">Known bugs and limitations</h2>
<p>Firefox's UI is extremely laggy on my computer (integrated Intel card). I don't know the reasons, and I can't reproduce it using <code>awesomewm</code>. However, myself and some people in <code>#lobsters</code> on freenode experienced the same problems in <code>dwm</code>. Given that I've read the source code of the latter, I suspect that firefox expects the window manager to do some fancy things that the more minimalistic ones refuse to do. This is all the more surprising considering that I can't reproduce it using <code>Xephyr</code> and that no apparent increase in resource usage is visible. This will need more serious investigation, but I fear that this is an issue I won't be able to solve trivially.</p>
<p>After some discussion with people on IRC I suspect the fact that reparenting might be a feature firefox in some way assumes to be present, which might cause this bug. If this is the case, I will have a lot to do :).</p>
